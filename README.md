# Xonomy

This is an experimental Typescript port of Xonomy.
For now it's published on NPM under https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kcmertens/xonomy 

# What works, what doesn't? 

- [x] types work when used as a dependency
- [x] css is emitted separately, and works
- [x] works when added in a webpage as <script>
- [ ] (untested) might not work when used with `import`
- the code is as-yet untested!
