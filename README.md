# Xonomy

This is an experimental Typescript port of Xonomy.
For now it's published on NPM under https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kcmertens/xonomy 

# What works, what doesn't? 

- types work when this is added as a dependency
- css is not published, and so does not work yet
- the library probably will not work when imported through `<script>` tag yet, and probably needs to go through a bundler (for now).
- jquery is not marked as dependency (yet)
- the code is as-yet untested!
